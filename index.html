  <p>Sometimes it seems like everyone on the internet is making money… except me.</p>
  <p>Can you relate?</p>
  <p>I failed at every web-based business I tried to build. Because I could never get started.</p>
  <p>I would get nerd-sniped by insignificant technical decisions, obsess over designs that no one would ever see, distract myself by which shiny new technology to use, or convince myself that I couldn’t be successful unless I mastered <em>XYZ</em> first through a book or online course.</p>
  <p>So now I’m going to try the opposite.</p>
  <p>I’m going to do things backwards.</p>
  <p>I’m going to start with the end — the famed <strong>checkout button</strong> — first, and then work my way backwards. All while staying on the cutting-edge of mediocrity.</p>
  <p>I call it <dfn>backwards development</dfn>.
  <p><em>Start</em> at the <em>End</em>, and then work your way backwards. This is the mantra.</p>
  <p>There’s no product, no marketing campaign, no team, no plan. Just a checkout button. </p>
  <p>It’s not much, but it’s a start. Or is the end?</p>
  <p>I have nothing of value to offer you at the moment. Yet. Now my job is to work backwards to make the button below worth clicking.</p>
