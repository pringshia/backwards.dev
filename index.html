  <h1>ba<span>ck</span>wards.dev</h1>
  <p>Sometimes it seems like everyone on the internet is making money… except me.</p>
  <p>Can you relate?</p>
  <p>I failed at every web-based business I tried to build. Because I could never get started.</p>
  <p>I would get nerd-sniped by insignificant technical decisions, obsess over designs that no one would ever see, distract myself by which shiny new technology to use, convince myself that I couldn’t be successful unless I mastered <em>XYZ</em> first through a book or online course, or struggle with the emotional turmoil of asking for money.</p>
  <p>So now I’m going to try the opposite.</p>
  <p>I’m going to do things backwards.</p>
  <p>I’m going to start with the end — the famed <strong>Pay Me button</strong> — first, and then work my way backwards. All while staying on the cutting-edge of mediocrity.</p>
  <p>I call it <dfn>backwards development</dfn>.
  <p>Make <em>the end</em> the <em>start</em>, and then work my way backwards. This is the mantra.</p>
  <p>There’s no product, no service, no marketing campaign, no team, no plan. Just a Pay Me button that works.</p>
  <p>It’s not much, but it’s a start. Or is the end?</p>

  <form method="get" action="https://paypal.me/backwardsdev">
    <p>At the moment, I have nothing of value to offer you. Yet. Now my job is to work backwards to make the button below worth clicking.</p>

    <button type="submit" class="pay-me">Pay Me</button>
    <p>Earnings so far: $0</p>
  </form>
